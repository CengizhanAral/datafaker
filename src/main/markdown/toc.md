concepts such as:

- requirements
- code quality
  - automation / sonar / qodana /
- communication
- validation
- production (support/etc)

- simplify design (see Roch Hickey talks)
- naming things, having semantic naming
- ask questions, discuss
- have design sessions
- use the socratic method, detach from your own ideas.
- 

Concept:

The concept of the book could be a teacher explaining things to a student. Like maybe a small introduction, for example:

Student: "what is the best way to test an Microservice?"
Teacher: There's a couple of things to take into account when testing microservices, such as: x, y, z.

then, after most of the concepts have been explained, supported by code examples, we would like to interview an 
industry expert about the subject.

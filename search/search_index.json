Please have a look at Transformation Schemas instead) \u00b6 Since version 1.2.0 of Datafaker it's possible to export generated data to a file format of your choice. The currently supported file formats are: CSV JSON SQL YAML XML CSV \u00b6 Using the CSV generation, it's possible to do the following: the number and names of columns could be specified the separator and quotes could be specified with separator() and quote() the number of lines could be specified via limit() with or without header also could be specified with header() An example can be found below: Java System . out . println ( Format . toCsv ( Csv . Column . of ( \"first_name\" , () -> faker . name (). firstName ()), Csv . Column . of ( \"last_name\" , () -> faker . name (). lastName ()), Csv . Column . of ( \"address\" , () -> faker . address (). streetAddress ())) . header ( true ) . separator ( \" ; \" ) . limit ( 5 ). build (). get ()); Executing the above will result in something similar to the below: \"first_name\" ; \"last_name\" ; \"address\" \"Jonah\" ; \"Kovacek\" ; \"009 Wilkinson Summit\" \"John\" ; \"Murphy\" ; \"379 McCullough Locks\" \"Colby\" ; \"Bins\" ; \"93534 Stevie Gardens\" \"Wade\" ; \"Herzog\" ; \"83108 Willy Road\" \"Marg\" ; \"Effertz\" ; \"415 Gene Plaza\" Another example using a fake sequence builder: Java Java System . out . println ( Format . toCsv ( faker . collection ( faker :: name ). build ()) . headers (() -> \"first_name\" , () -> \"last_name\" ) . columns ( Name :: firstName , Name :: lastName ) . separator ( \" ; \" ) . limit ( 2 ). build (). get ()); System . out . println ( Format . toCsv ( faker . stream ( faker :: name ). build ()) . headers (() -> \"first_name\" , () -> \"last_name\" ) . columns ( Name :: firstName , Name :: lastName ) . separator ( \" ; \" ) . limit ( 2 ). build (). get ()); The result in both cases looks something like this: \"first_name\" ; \"last_name\" \"Jonah\" ; \"Kovacek\" \"John\" ; \"Murphy\" Note: you can generate a CSV from an infinite FakeStream in case if you specified limit parameter for the result CSV, otherwise you will get an exception.

However, it won't work for complex JSON generation: Java Faker faker = new Faker (); System . out . println ( Format . toJson () . set ( \"firstName\" , () -> faker . name (). firstName ()) . set ( \"lastName\" , () -> faker . name (). lastName ()) . set ( \"address\" , () -> faker . address (). country ()) . build (). generate ()); This will produce JSON similar to the following: { \"firstName\" : \"Clemencia\" , \"lastName\" : \"Collier\" , \"address\" : \"Nauru\" } It's also possible to generate a more complex JSON: Java Faker faker = new Faker (); String json = Format . toJson ( faker . collection ( faker :: name ) . len ( 2 ) . build ()) . set ( \"firstName\" , Name :: firstName ) . set ( \"lastName\" , Name :: lastName ) . set ( \"address\" , Format . toJson ( faker . collection ( faker :: address ) . len ( 1 ) . build ()) . set ( \"country\" , Address :: country ) . set ( \"city\" , Address :: city ) . set ( \"zipcode\" , Address :: zipCode ) . set ( \"streetAddress\" , Address :: streetAddress ) . build ()) . set ( \"phones\" , name -> faker . collection (() -> faker . phoneNumber (). phoneNumber ()). maxLen ( 3 ). build (). get ()) . build () . generate (); System . out . println ( json ); The same could be achieved with FakeStream: Java Faker faker = new Faker (); String json = Format . toJson ( faker . stream ( faker :: name ) . len ( 2 ) . build ()) . set ( \"firstName\" , Name :: firstName ) . set ( \"lastName\" , Name :: lastName ) . set ( \"address\" , Format . toJson ( faker . stream ( faker :: address ) . len ( 1 ) . build ()) . set ( \"country\" , Address :: country ) . set ( \"city\" , Address :: city ) . set ( \"zipcode\" , Address :: zipCode ) . set ( \"streetAddress\" , Address :: streetAddress ) . build ()) . set ( \"phones\" , name -> faker . stream (() -> faker . phoneNumber (). phoneNumber ()). maxLen ( 3 ). build (). get ()) . build () . generate (); System . out . println ( json ); This will produce something similar to the following: [{ \"firstName\" : \"Azucena\" , \"lastName\" : \"Block\" , \"address\" : [{ \"country\" : \"Micronesia\" , \"city\" : \"Ralphberg\" , \"zipcode\" : \"03792\" , \"streetAddress\" : \"522 Detra Motorway\" }], \"phones\" : [ \"885.387.7538 x3339\" , \"673-179-8684 x7840\" , \"512-510-3469 x47468\" ]}, { \"firstName\" : \"Hollis\" , \"lastName\" : \"Conroy\" , \"address\" : [{ \"country\" : \"Anguilla\" , \"city\" : \"Murrayshire\" , \"zipcode\" : \"96973\" , \"streetAddress\" : \"84545 Carolyne Hills\" }], \"phones\" : [ \"133.943.3781 x16122\" , \"797.830.4970 x310\" , \"(599) 214-5520 x920\" ]}] Another example with json payload Java Faker faker = new Faker (); String json = Format . toJson ( faker . collection ( faker :: name ). faker ( faker ) . len ( 2 ) . build ()) . set ( \"firstName\" , Name :: firstName ) . set ( \"lastName\" , Name :: lastName ) . set ( \"payload\" , payload -> Format . toJson ( faker . collection ( faker :: address ) . len ( 1 ) . build ()) . set ( \"country\" , Address :: country ) . set ( \"city\" , Address :: city ) . set ( \"zipcode\" , Address :: zipCode ) . set ( \"streetAddress\" , Address :: streetAddress ) . build (). generate ()) . set ( \"phones\" , name -> faker . collection (() -> faker . phoneNumber (). phoneNumber ()). maxLen ( 3 ). build (). get ()) . build () . generate (); System . out . println ( json ); This will produce json with escaped json payload e.g.: [{ \"firstName\" : \"Rey\" , \"lastName\" : \"Hilpert\" , \"payload\" : \"[{\\\"country\\\": \\\"Vanuatu\\\", \\\"city\\\": \\\"Douglasborough\\\", \\\"zipcode\\\": \\\"78956\\\", \\\"streetAddress\\\": \\\"15586 DuBuque Circles\\\"}]\" , \"phones\" : [ \"(739) 078-6320\" , \"(530) 089-9967 x167\" , \"422.892.6273 x46644\" ]}, { \"firstName\" : \"Timmy\" , \"lastName\" : \"Lakin\" , \"payload\" : \"[{\\\"country\\\": \\\"Chile\\\", \\\"city\\\": \\\"East Frederick\\\", \\\"zipcode\\\": \\\"07470\\\", \\\"streetAddress\\\": \\\"425 Hackett Tunnel\\\"}]\" , \"phones\" : [ \"416.215.9044\" , \"700.631.9476\" , \"1-521-484-1096\" ]}] YAML \u00b6 A lightweight YAML generator is now built into Datafaker. The following is an example on how to use it: Java Faker faker = new Faker (); Map < Supplier < String > , Supplier < Object >> map = new LinkedHashMap <> (); Map < Supplier < String > , Supplier < Object >> address = new LinkedHashMap <> (); Map < Supplier < String > , Supplier < Object >> phones = new LinkedHashMap <> (); phones . put (() -> \"worknumbers\" , () -> faker . < String > collection (). suppliers (() -> faker . phoneNumber (). phoneNumber ()). maxLen ( 2 ). build (). get ()); phones . put (() -> \"cellphones\" , () -> faker . < String > collection (). suppliers (() -> faker . phoneNumber (). cellPhone ()). maxLen ( 3 ). build (). get ()); address . put (() -> \"city\" , () -> faker . address (). city ()); address . put (() -> \"country\" , () -> faker . address (). country ()); address . put (() -> \"streetAddress\" , () -> faker . address (). streetAddress ()); map . put (() -> \"name\" , () -> faker . name (). firstName ()); map . put (() -> \"lastname\" , () -> faker . name (). lastName ()); map . put (() -> \"address\" , () -> address ); map . put (() -> \"phones\" , () -> phones ); Yaml yaml = new Yaml ( map ); System . out . println ( yaml . generate ()); XML \u00b6 Elements and attributes \u00b6 In case you want to generate XML, Datafaker provides a facility to build XML elements and attributes using randomly generated data in the following way: Java public static void main ( String [] args ) { Faker faker = new Faker (); Collection < Xml . XmlNode > address = faker . < Xml . XmlNode > collection () . suppliers (() -> new Xml . XmlNode ( \"address\" , map ( entry ( \"country\" , faker . address (). country ()), entry ( \"city\" , faker . address (). city ()), entry ( \"streetAddress\" , faker . address (). streetAddress ())), Collections . emptyList ())) . maxLen ( 3 ). build (). get (); Collection < Xml . XmlNode > persons = faker . < Xml . XmlNode > collection () . suppliers (() -> new Xml . XmlNode ( \"person\" , map ( entry ( \"firstname\" , faker . name (). firstName ()), entry ( \"lastname\" , faker . name (). lastName ())), of ( new Xml . XmlNode ( \"addresses\" , address )))). maxLen ( 3 ). build (). get (); String str = new Xml ( new Xml . XmlNode ( \"persons\" , persons )). generate ( true ); System . out . println ( str ); } private static < T > Collection < T > of ( T ... elems ) { return Arrays . asList ( elems ); } private static Map . Entry < String , String > entry ( String key , String value ) { return new AbstractMap . SimpleEntry <> ( key , value ); } private static Map < String , String > map ( Map . Entry < String , String > ... entries ) { Map < String , String > map = new LinkedHashMap <> (); for ( Map . Entry < String , String > entry : entries ) { map . put ( entry . getKey (), entry . getValue ()); } return map ; } This will produce the following output: <persons> <person firstname= \"Chuck\" lastname= \"Rice\" > <addresses> <address country= \"Croatia\" city= \"South Stacimouth\" streetAddress= \"8958 Ervin Stravenue\" /> <address country= \"Uruguay\" city= \"South Cariefort\" streetAddress= \"59014 Howell Pike\" /> <address country= \"Bahrain\" city= \"New Ian\" streetAddress= \"446 Wuckert Brooks\" /> </addresses> </person> <person firstname= \"Brent\" lastname= \"Walter\" > <addresses> <address country= \"Croatia\" city= \"South Stacimouth\" streetAddress= \"8958 Ervin Stravenue\" /> <address country= \"Uruguay\" city= \"South Cariefort\" streetAddress= \"59014 Howell Pike\" /> <address country= \"Bahrain\" city= \"New Ian\" streetAddress= \"446 Wuckert Brooks\" /> </addresses> </person> <person firstname= \"Amy\" lastname= \"Parisian\" > <addresses> <address country= \"Croatia\" city= \"South Stacimouth\" streetAddress= \"8958 Ervin Stravenue\" /> <address country= \"Uruguay\" city= \"South Cariefort\" streetAddress= \"59014 Howell Pike\" /> <address country= \"Bahrain\" city= \"New Ian\" streetAddress= \"446 Wuckert Brooks\" /> </addresses> </person> </persons> Elements only \u00b6 In case you only want to generate XML elements, without any attributes, that possible too: Java Faker faker = new Faker (); Collection < Xml .

Hardware & Software \u00b6 All the tests are done with help of JMH at Fedora 36 for different JDKs (mentioned in tables below). The laptop has 32Gb of RAM, AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U with Radeon Graphics. Datafaker (1.4.0) vs Java Faker (1.0.2) vs Kotlin-faker (1.11.0) vs JFairy (0.6.5) \u00b6 Originally Datafaker started as a fork of java-faker. For java-faker there have been mentions of the poor performance of the library, and this document will compare the performance of the respective libraries against each other. Recently, the 1.4.0 version of Datafaker has been released, and we'll look into what this says about performance improvements. To demonstrate the performance, we're going to use JMH benchmarks. All the code is available as a separate project because of JMH license reasons. Since it's hardly possible and reasonable to compare each method's performance, we'll focus on a subset of features in this article. In the below, you can see that Datafaker is about 10x-100x times faster for several cases. JDK effects \u00b6 Also, there is an interesting fact: in case of Datafaker moving from jdk8 to jdk18 performance is improving up to 25%, while for Java Faker it is not happening. It seems in Java Faker there are some time-consuming operations blocking such improvements from updating java version which partially were fixed in Datafaker. There is also Kotlin-faker , which a performance comparison table in README page. Unfortunately there is not so much information what kind of benchmarks have been executed. After some search across the project I was able to find only this page So, it looks like the only test which were done is checking Faker.name().name() performance. Ok, let's start with the similar test here. Similar, because we are going to use JMH which was not used in their test. If applicable we try to execute same tests we did for previous section.

More Fun \u00b6 There is an issue in Java Faker about generation of 100M of objects. Of course, the task could be solved with concurrent generation in multiple threads. However, here it is interesting how much a 1 thread application can generated in 1 hour. The code below for Datafaker generates a bit more than 170M objects for 1 hour. The same code for Java Faker generates about 38M for 1 hour, meaning on average, Datafaker is about 4x faster than Javafaker. Kotlin Faker does not support setting of birthday and blood. Without these 2 params it generates about 90M for 1 hour. net.datafaker.benchmark.generate_one_hour","title":"Datafaker 1.4.0"},{"location":"documentation/performance140/#performance-benchmarks","text":"This page is trying to go through some performance metrics and see how better/worse Datafaker is in compare with Java Faker and other similar projects.","title":"Performance benchmarks"},{"location":"documentation/performance140/#hardware-software","text":"All the tests are done with help of JMH at Fedora 36 for different JDKs (mentioned in tables below).

All the code is available as a separate project because of JMH license reasons. Since it's hardly possible and reasonable to compare each method's performance, we'll focus on a subset of features in this article.

It seems in Java Faker there are some time-consuming operations blocking such improvements from updating java version which partially were fixed in Datafaker. There is also Kotlin-faker , which a performance comparison table in README page. Unfortunately there is not so much information what kind of benchmarks have been executed. After some search across the project I was able to find only this page So, it looks like the only test which were done is checking Faker.name().name() performance. Ok, let's start with the similar test here. Similar, because we are going to use JMH which was not used in their test. If applicable we try to execute same tests we did for previous section.

Of course, the task could be solved with concurrent generation in multiple threads. However, here it is interesting how much a 1 thread application can generated in 1 hour. The code below for Datafaker generates a bit more than 170M objects for 1 hour. The same code for Java Faker generates about 38M for 1 hour, meaning on average, Datafaker is about 4x faster than Javafaker. Kotlin Faker does not support setting of birthday and blood.

It also provides a set of ready to use transformers: CSV JSON SQL YAML XML Java Object Schema \u00b6 Schema is a set of rules describing what should be done to transform data from Datafaker representation to one of the supported formats. One of the main advantages of Schema is that the same schema could be used to transform to different formats. Schema can be used in 2 ways: it could be used to generate data from scratch or it could be used to transform existing data. Example of schema definition: Java Schema < String , String > schema = Schema . of ( field ( \"first_name\" , () -> faker . name (). firstName ()), field ( \"last_name\" , () -> faker . name (). lastName ()), field ( \"address\" , () -> faker . address (). streetAddress ())); It is also supported nested(composite) fields e.g.: Java Schema . of ( compositeField ( \"key\" , new Field [] { field ( \"key\" , () -> \"value\" )})); CSV transformation \u00b6 CSV transformer could be build with help of CsvTransformer.CsvTransformerBuilder e.g. Java CsvTransformer < String > transformer = new CsvTransformer . CsvTransformerBuilder < String > (). header ( true ). separator ( separator ). build (); The following can be configured: the separator and quotes could be specified with separator() and quote() with or without header also could be specified with header() To generate data based on a schema just call generate against schema : Java String csv = transformer . generate ( schema , limit ); Also it's possible to use schemas to transform existing data. E.g. there is a collection of Name objects and we are going to build csv of first and last names based on this collection: Java Schema < Name , String > schema = Schema . of ( field ( \"firstName\" , Name :: firstName ), field ( \"lastname\" , Name :: lastName )); CsvTransformer < Name > transformer = new CsvTransformer . CsvTransformerBuilder < Name > (). header ( false ). separator ( \" : \" ). build (); String csv = transformer . generate ( faker . < Name > collection (). suppliers ( faker :: name ). maxLen ( limit ). build (), schema ); JSON transformation \u00b6 JSON transformation is very similar to CSV. The main difference is that JSON supports nested values which could be handled with help of compositeField . Example of JSON generation: Java Schema < Object , ?> schema = Schema . of ( field ( \"Text\" , () -> faker . name (). firstName ()), field ( \"Bool\" , () -> faker . bool (). bool ()) ); JsonTransformer < Object > transformer = new JsonTransformer <> (); String json = transformer . generate ( schema , 2 ); To use composite fields it should be defined on Schema level and nothing more. SQL Transformation \u00b6 Note: right now only INSERT is supported. It generates a number of INSERT statements. There are 2 modes: batch and non batch generation. Batch generation means that one INSERT statement contains several rows to insert. Since different databases could have different syntax there is initial support for different dialects. Dialect could be specified during SQLTransformaer build e.g: Java SqlTransformer < String > transformer = new SqlTransformer . SqlTransformerBuilder < String > () . schemaName ( tableSchemaName ). dialect ( SqlDialect . ORACLE ). build (); Dialect also handle SQL quote identifiers, quotes and other SQL dialect specifics. An example of batch mode: Java Faker faker = new Faker (); Schema < String , String > schema = Schema . of ( field ( \"firstName\" , () -> faker . name (). firstName ()), field ( \"lastName\" , () -> faker . name (). lastName ())); SqlTransformer < String > transformer = new SqlTransformer . SqlTransformerBuilder < String > () . batch ( 5 ) . tableName ( \"MY_TABLE\" ) . dialect ( SqlDialect . POSTGRES ) . build (); String output = transformer . generate ( schema , 10 ); will generate 2 INSERT each containing 5 rows e.g. INSERT INTO MY_TABLE (\"firstName\", \"lastName\") VALUES ('Billy', 'Wintheiser'), ('Fernando', 'Sanford'), ('Jamey', 'Torp'), ('Nicolette', 'Wiza'), ('Sherman', 'Miller'); INSERT INTO MY_TABLE (\"firstName\", \"lastName\") VALUES ('Marcell', 'Walsh'), ('Kareen', 'Bode'), ('Jules', 'Homenick'), ('Lashay', 'Gaylord'), ('Tyler', 'Miller'); Advanced SQL types \u00b6 It also supports generation of ARRAY , MULTISET and ROW types. Please be aware that not every database engine supports it and datafaker could do it for every dialect. To generate ARRAY schema field should supply and array. To generate MULTISET schema field should supply a list (SQL MULTISET could contain duplicates) To generate ROW schema field should supply a compositeField e.g. Java Schema . of ( field ( \"ints\" , () -> new int [] { 1 , 2 , 3 })); will lead to INSERT INTO \"MyTable\" (\"ints\") VALUES (ARRAY[1, 2, 3]); Java Schema . of ( field ( \"names_multiset\" , () -> Collections . singleton ( \"hello\" )); will lead to INSERT INTO \"MyTable\" (\"names_multiset\") VALUES (MULTISET['hello']); Java chema . of ( compositeField ( \"row\" , new Field [] { field ( \"name\" , () -> \"2\" )}); will lead to INSERT INTO \"MyTable\" (\"row\") VALUES (ROW('2')); YAML transformation \u00b6 YAML transformation is very similar to CSV.
